  -- https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/285
  -- LuaJIT 2.1 on arm64 currently (as of commit b4b2dce) can only use memory
  -- for JIT compilation within a certain short range. Other libraries such as
  -- SDL can take all the usable space in that range and cause attempts at JIT
  -- compilation to both fail and take a long time.
  -- This is a very hacky attempt at a workaround. LuaJIT allocates executable
  -- code in pools. We'll try "reserving" pools before any external code is
  -- executed, by causing JIT compilation via a small loop. We can't easily
  -- tell if JIT compilation succeeded, so we do several successively smaller
  -- pool allocations in case previous ones fail.
  -- This is a really hacky hack and by no means foolproof - there are a lot of
  -- potential situations (especially when threads are used) where previously
  -- executed external code will still take up space that LuaJIT needed for itself.
